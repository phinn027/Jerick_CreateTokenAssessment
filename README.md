# Create Token
This Solidity program is a "Create a Token" program that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language. 

## Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 
The contract has a function that create your own token.

## Executing Program
To run this program, we can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), 
and then click on the "Compile HelloWorld.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. 

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by first putting a value then copy the account address. Next is going to the mint function by pasting the account adress that you copy.
Then put a value in mint function then transact. Next step is checking the balance how much do you have. lastly, is same procedure with mint fucntion by pasting the address and put a value of how much you will deduct your current balance.
After that we can now test the program that you created.
